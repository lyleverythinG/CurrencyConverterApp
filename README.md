# Currency Converter IOS App(Swift)
_This simple currency converter app made with Swift is the first app I made written in this language and the start of my journey learning it._
# My Changes
- Removed hard coded currency values and fetched actual values from the API.
- Added real currency options (php,usd,hk).
- Added local storage to cache values and limit fetching to once per day.(24hr expiration).
# NOTE
- I followed a udemy course which is this one, https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/.
- After I finished the first app from the course, I modifed the project for practice and learning purposes.
# SETUP
- Add your own API key inside `ExchangeRateService` file. Create your key here,  Link: https://freecurrencyapi.com/'
